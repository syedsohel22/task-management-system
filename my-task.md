## Assignment: Build a Task Management System

Description:

You are tasked with creating a web-based task management system using the MERN stack. The system should allow users to create, update, and delete tasks. Users should be able to log in and manage their tasks. The system should also include the following features:

1. User Authentication: Implement authentication and authorization to ensure that only authenticated users can create, update, and delete tasks.
2. Task CRUD Operations: Users should be able to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks. Tasks should have a title, description, due date, status, and assigned user (automatically showcase all users in this dropdown field)
3. Admin Dashboard: Implement a dashboard (https://d3js.org/ ) where Admin can view and manage all user's tasks. The dashboard should display the user's tasks in an organized manner and provide options to FILTER OR SORT OR SEARCH for tasks. [Only D3js allowed for dashboard task - If done via other sources, 'll not be entertained]
4. Responsive Design: Make sure the application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes, including desktop and mobile devices.
